# Phase 1 Notes

## Missing value analysis
Cabin seems to have the highest missing values followed by age. An interesting note about Cabin is
that there are repeated cases in it, e.g. by those in the same family.

Why is Cabin important?
- Cabin is important as it may highlight regions of the boat that was susceptible to the iceberg
  which may in turn affect survival rates.

Why was most of the Cabin entries missing?
- Perhaps privacy, it may be in the best interest of the passangers that whoever has access to this
  list not know the locations of passangers.
- Although... I would assume that when signing off someone has a record of which cabin each
  passanger belongs to (just like in a hotel?)
- Even so the ones that were filled up were done by families, perhaps this is necessary in order to
  locate family members in times of emergency.

Why is age important?
- Reports show that women and children were most likely to survive, it may have a correlation with
  survival rates.

Why was age missing?
- In several data sets, age often has a high missing value rate. Again this may be a privacy thing.
- Though I don't see why people will hide the age of their children, so it may be useful to
  identify children
